            There are many parallels throughout the history of game distribution with modern problems. For instance, paying money 
            for games without purchasing ownership of a copy, and the problems of size and storage media. There are also interesting 
            experiments, such as broadcasting data via radio as an early form of digital distribution. <i>Click to read more</i>

            The current standard for game distribution is through digital download onto internal storage. Physical distribution does still
            happen, but the game usually needs digital updates and to be installed onto internal storage. There are many reasons why 
            this has become the standard, as well as disadvantages to this strategy. <i>Click to read more</i>

            In the last 10 years, the big experiments in game distribution have been related to cloud gaming, with services such as 
            Google Stadia. However, these services are far from supplanting digital download, and Google Stadia is generally 
            considered to be a failure. <i>Click to read more</i>

            While there has been years of failure for cloud gaming, this is nothing new for a new distribution technology. The use of 
            Compact Disk and its predecessors had a similarly rocky start before the breakthrough release of Sony's Playstation.
            Additionally, there are services which look much more promising than Stadia, such as Nvidia's Geforce Now. <i>Click to read more.</i>
