<div style="height:64px"></div>


<h2>Subscription model</h2>

<p>When video rental was supplanted by video streaming in the late 2000s, game rental mostly went down with it.
    However, unlike video, game rental was replaced with digital stores, allowing you to own digital copies of 
    games and download them at any time to play them. It wasn't until recent services like Xbox Game Pass 
    that subscription models similar to video streaming started to gain popularity.</p>

<h2>Cloud Gaming</h2>

<p>Cloud gaming is an alternative to digital download, where the game is instead run on a server, 
    receiving control inputs and streaming the resulting video back to the player over the internet.</p>

<h3>Advantage</h3>

<p>There are two key advantages to this idea: the convenience of being able to play games without download, 
    and the ability to play the latest big games without buying an expensive computer or console to be able to run them.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>There are two sides to the problems with cloud gaming. The first is technical, as cloud gaming requires transmitting
    a large amount of data with very low latency to be a good experience. The second is more socio-economic, to do 
    with pricing schemes, the games available on the service, and how the customer gains access to them.</p>

<h2>Google Stadia</h2>

<p>Google Stadia is a very good case study for cloud gaming. On the one hand, the technology behind it is very sound.
    The engineers at Google identified one of the key concerns with cloud gaming - added latency - and created a smart solution for it.
    Because it's Google, they can leverage existing datacenters around the world to create very short travel time for 
    packets, just a few ms, so the problem isn't the transmission of data, but the encoding and decoding. This is another 
    area Google already excels in, as there have been years of development for codecs for YouTube to allow responsive
    video playback and live-streaming with a delay of only a few seconds. However, latency for a video game should at least 
    be under 100ms to be an acceptable experience, and ideally under 50ms for a good experience - and that's including 
    10-70ms of latency introduced by the display itself. Another area they use for optimisation is in the transmission
    protocols, where they've implemented their own version of Bottleneck Bandwith and Round-trip propagation time.
    Another key optimisation is with buffering. With the incredibly low latency required for cloud gaming, the window 
    within which a packet is still useful is incredibly short, making buffering not only unhelpful, but actively detrimental
    as it can delay the arrival of actually useful packets. So, to disable buffering, Google uses WebRTC extensions 
    on the receiver-side.</p>

<p>However, despite their impressive technology, Google Stadia is widely considered a failure. The reasons behind this 
    are fairly simple - Google tried to create Stadia as a service with its own digital storefront, entering a 
    highly competitive and unfamiliar market. They spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring titles to put on their service,
    but even then the selection of games available were considered unsatisfactory. On top of this, their pricing model 
    has customers subscribe to the service, but then also purchase the games they want to play on Stadia's storefront, 
    which goes against usual customer expectations of a subscription model (though a small selection of games 
    were included with the subscription)</p>

<!--In the last 10 years, the hottest new experiment in game distribution has been "cloud gaming", a similar idea to remote desktop,
where your inputs are sent to a remote machine, and the results are sent back. In this case, rather than a whole computer,
it's an instance of a game running on servers.

There are many attractive benefits to this idea, the main being the ability to play a game without first downloading it
or obtaining a physical copy, the former being a rather time-consuming task with the enormous scale of the latest releases.
It also allows you to play a game on a much cheaper system, as it only has to process the resulting video from the server,
instead of the intensive rendering of the game.

There are also a lot of potential problems. First, this requires a lot of bandwidth, as streaming video usually does, but this
is a non-issue for most customers, as evidenced by the ubiquity of services like Netflix, and even live-streaming services,
such as for live sports events or services like Twitch. Second, a related problem, the latency is considerably more important
for this than even for live-streaming services. It's common for a live-streaming service to have a delay of several seconds,
but this is unacceptable for most video games. Going by the example of online multiplayer games, latency above 300ms
is considered unusable for almost all games, and latency above 100ms is considered unusable for games requiring faster
reaction times, such as first-person shooters. This latency is not equivalent to the acceptable latency for cloud gaming,
however, as for online multiplayer games the player still sees the results of their actions rendered to their screen with
very low latency (with the lowest reaching ~10ms, but averaging ~30ms, and 60-70ms on the high end), before their actions
have been confirmed by the server or transmitted to other players. The result of high latency for these games is the server or
host deciding that something different to what a player saw on their screen happened which can result in, for example,
the player's avatar appearing to teleport around as their system tries to correct events to match what the server decides.

So the big problem here is achieving lower latency than most online multiplayer games, while transmitting many orders of 
magnitude more data, and even then the additional latency from cloud gaming may result in an unsatisfactory experience if 
they already have high-latency hardware (usually due to their choice of TV)

The other problem is how the cloud gaming platform offers the games. In the worst case, they would be presenting themselves
as a competing platform and marketplace to existing consoles and stores, having to convince publishers to put games on their
new, experimental service. This case is exactly what happened with Google Stadia, with Google spending tens of millions of 
USD to put third party titles onto their service, and even then having a far too small library of games to compete in the
market they placed themselves. On top of this, their purchase model was unappealing, requiring customers to pay a subscription
fee just for access to the service. Once subscribed, customers would then have to buy any games they wanted to play on 
Stadia's store. While this pricing model makes sense when compared to having to purchase an expensive gaming machine to be
able to play the same games, it isn't what customers expect from a subscription model. Google have also added a higher 
subscription tier, which provides the customer access to a limited selection of games for no extra fee, but these games 
are typically older or lower-budget titles, not what Google was marketing Stadia to be the platform for.

Unfortunately, due to the competitive nature of the industry, most technical details about the streaming technology of these 
new services is confidential, so most discussion of these details will be speculation based on the information that is 
available, such as performance metrics.-->
