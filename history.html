        <h3>Early Computers</h3>
        <p>In the 1970s, when home computers started to gain traction, internal storage was very expensive, so these computers
            were capable of using external storage, such as floppy disks or the far cheaper audio cassette. This follows a trend
            of computers using storage initially created for music, video etc. as generic data storage.</p>
        <h3>Radio Experiments</h3>
        <p>Since audio cassettes were already a common way to store and distribute data, including games, it was fairly simple
            to turn that same data into a radio signal. Nederlandse Omroep Stichting is a company which pioneered this technology, 
            starting a radio show "Hobbyscoop" for transmitting data in the 1980s</p>
        <h3>The Internet</h3>
        <p>By the end of the 1980s, increasingly powerful computers led to increasingly large data, and radio transmission became
            infeasible for distribution. However, the 1990s saw the rise of the internet, and the transition into the current
            <a href="./state.html" class="inline-link">State of the Art</a> of distribution.</p>

        <h3>Early Consoles</h3>
        <p>In the 1970s, gaming consoles typically had a small number of games built into them. This changed with the 
            second generation of consoles in the late 70s, where cartridges were used to allow one console to 
            play many different games</p>
        <h3>Rental</h3>
        <p>In the late 1980s, video rental companies like 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_LLC" target="_blank" class="inline-link" alt="Wikipedia article on Blockbuster">Blockbuster</a> 
            started to appear, also offering rentals of games. However, game rental mostly died with video rental and the increasing popularity of 
            <a href="./state.html" class="inline-link">digital download</a> in the late 2000s.</p>
        <h3>Storage Experiments</h3>
        <p>Starting from the mid 1980s, there were many experiments with non-cartirdge games, with attachments for existing consoles 
            such as the Famicom Disk System, and consoles such as the Phillips CD-i. However, cartridges remained the standard 
            until the Sony Playstation.</p>
        <h3>Digital Experiments</h3>
        <p>Along with storage experiments, there were also experiments such as the SatellaView (pictured right), which used a 
            satellite modem to recieve data in a similar manner to television broadcasts.</p>

<p>
In the 1970s, audio cassettes were a common medium for storing data for computers, including programs (and by extension, computer games). 
while they were very slow, they offered incredibly cheap and portable storage, making it a common way to distribute games, especially 
those made on a small budget. Because of this, it was possible to transmit games and other data in the same way you would audio - 
via radio broadcasts. </p>

<p>
In the 1980s, Nederlandse Omroep Stichting pioneered this technique, starting a radio show "Hobbyscoop" for 
transmitting game data.</p>

<p>
However, as storage and processing capabilities grew exponentially, leading to increasingly large files,
this technique became unfeasible for transmitting this sort of data by the end of the 1980s</p>

<p>
This is far from the end of the story, though, as the 1990s saw the rise of the internet.</p>

<p>
A lot of this is in reference to computers, which were highly flexible in their use and accessories, allowing 
innovations like this to quickly take on. Computers were not the only way people would play games in the 80s and 90s.
In the 1980s, the most common form of distribution media for console games was the cartridge, a very different format
from the audio cassette. This, along with the more rigid nature of these gaming consoles, made it difficult to take 
up innovations like radio broadcast games. However, there were experiments done to create accessories and add-ons
for consoles in the 80s and 90s that would allow them to receive games in a similar way.</p>

<p>
As with most add-ons to gaming consoles like this, they did not perform well. These experiments were similar to 
experiments made with these consoles to add compatibility with different distribution media, usually to take
advantage of greater storage capacity or cheaper manufacturing, such as the Famicom Disk System (that's disk
as in floppy disk, not compact disk), and the Sega CD. These add-ons were often expensive, and almost always
sacrificed the fast loading times of cartridges for the benefits of the new media, making them unattractive
to the customer. The difference in media also meant a split in the library of games for a system, meaning 
there was usually a very small selection of games available for the add-ons, and most of them first-party,
as third-party developers had little incentive to learn how to make games for a new distribution media when 
that new media inherently came with a smaller potential audience.</p>

<p>
With Sony's release of the PlayStation in the 1990s, the use of the slower, but far cheaper and higher capacity, compact 
disks came to prevail over the longstanding cartirdge-based model, due to the same problems which plagued the 
radio distribution system - cartridges simply couldn't be made with a high enough capacity for the scale of games
the customer and the hardware were demanding. This, along with the CD being the only distribution media for the console 
(meaning no split customer-base) marked a new age for distribution media.</p>

<p>
At the same time as this, distribution via the internet started to gain use, and would only increase in popularity
as the price of internal storage dropped, and internet speeds soared, making downloading a game far more convenient
than purchasing a physical one, especially with the long load times resulting from the distribution media. This, however,
is reaching into the state of the art, which you can read more about <a>here</a>, or through the navbar.</p>-->
