    Thanks to increasingly cheap and fast internal storage and internet,
    the future is almost certainly digital, but is it digital downloads, or cloud gaming?</p>

<p class="conclusion-text" style="text-align:center">Digital downloads don't seem to be going away any time soon, and it's almost certain 
    it won't go away for good. At least with the current implementation, modding is simply not possible for cloud gaming, and it's inherently
    impossible for any games someone has acquired through a cloud gaming service to be played offline. Additionally, with most big releases 
    requiring installation and downloading updates anyway, physical media is unlikely to make a return without a drastic change in the 
    way games are made and consumed. However, the technology for cloud gaming does seem to be at a point now where it can provide a good 
    experience, and this will only improve over the coming years. Of the current cloud gaming services announced and available, Geforce Now 
    seems the most promising, followed by Playstation Now. Both of these services are made by companies that have been in the game industry for 
    many years, and they're backed by existing stores, solving the competition problem. Geforce Now has you pay just to be able to use their 
    servers for games you already own on stores like Steam, which has the disadvantage of mostly targeting people who already play games. 
    Playstation Now, on the other hand, provides access to all games on their service for the subscription. Upcoming Amazon Luna has a similar 
    model, with a cross between cable packages. Google Stadia, finally, seems to be the biggest failure. Not only do they charge a subscription, 
    you then have to buy the games on their own storefront to gain access to them (though a small selection are included in the subscription),
    and this is a large part of why this was a failure, and something other cloud gaming services should learn from.<br/>
    Ultimately, there are already good services in cloud gaming out there, it's just a matter of attracting customers to them,
        as a large number of potential customers are already capable of playing the games they offer, without the latency, as they have the 
        hardware already. I expect this to change within the next 10 years, however, when these services are more well-known and people 
        consider whether to buy the new hardware that will inevitably be released in order to keep playing new games, or switch to the 
        service - as well as people joining the hobby thanks to the low barrier to entry these services offer.</p>
